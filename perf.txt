This file contains various notes and lessons learned concerning performance
of the Homa Linux kernel module.

* Problem: large messages have no pipelining. For example, copying bytes
  from user space to output buffers is not overlapped with sending packets,
  and copying bytes from buffers to user space doesn't start until the
  entire message has been received.
  * Tried overlapping packet transmission with packet creation (7/2019) but
    this made performance worse, not better. Not sure why.

* Waking up a process after a message arrives is expensive (a few microseconds).
  * Tried polling for messages (7/2019), but this made performance worse
    because the softirq handler runs on the same CPU as the receiving user
    process.
