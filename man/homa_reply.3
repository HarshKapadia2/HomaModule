.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR homa_reply ()
transmits a response message using the Homa transport protocol.
The argument
.I sockfd
is the file descriptor of the sending socket; this must be a Homa socket.
The response is stored in a buffer pointed to by
.IR request .
The argument 
.I reqlen
gives the length of the message in bytes, which must not exceed
.BR HOMA_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH .
The destination for the request is given by
.I dest_addr
and
.I addrlen .
The argument
.I id
is an identifier previously returned by 
.BR homa_recv (3);
along with
.IR dest_addr ,
it identifies the request for which this message is the response.
If no such request is active,
.B homa_reply
returns (successfully) without doing anything.
.PP
This function returns as soon as the response has been queued for
transmission.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, the return value is 0.
On error, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
