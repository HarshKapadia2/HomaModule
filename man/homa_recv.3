.BI "                  const struct sockaddr *" src_addr ", size_t " \

.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR homa_recv ()
waits for the next incoming Homa message and returns it.
The argument
.I sockfd
is the file descriptor of the receiving socket; this must be a Homa socket.
The incoming message will be stored in the buffer pointed to by
.IR buf .
The argument
.I len
indicates the number of bytes available for the message; if the actual
message is larger than
.IR len ,
then excess bytes will be discarded.
The identifier for the message is returned at
.I *id
(unless id is NULL).

If
.I src_addr
is not NULL, the source address for the message is placed in the buffer
pointed to by
.IR src_addr .
The argument
.I addrlen
is a value-result argument.
Before the call, it should be initialized to the size of the
buffer associated with
.IR src_addr .
Upon return,
.I *addrlen
is updated to contain the actual size of the source address.
The returned address is truncated  if  the buffer provided is too small;
in this case,
.I *addrlen
will return a value greater than was supplied to the call.

Depending on how
.I sockfd
has been configured, the incoming message may be either a request or a response.
If it is a request, the port number stored in
.I src_addr
will be
.B HOMA_MIN_CLIENT_PORT
or greater.
A port number less than
.B HOMA_MIN_CLIENT_PORT
indicates that the message is a response (it originated at a server port).
If the message is a request, then the caller must eventually invoke
.BR homa_reply (3)
to respond (Homa retains state for the request until
.BR homa_reply (3)
is invoked).

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, the return value is the size of the response message,
which may be greater than
.IR resplen .
On error, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
.I sockfd
is not a valid open file descriptor.

The file descriptor
.I fockfd
did not refer to a Homa socket.
